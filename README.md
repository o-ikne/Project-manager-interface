## __Project manager interface__

### __Overview__

This repository contains an application interface for projects to be done. It's build using mainly __PyQt5__.

The proposed interface allow users to create their own account and manage their different projects.

Once the account is created, the user can log in and create new projects.

Each project contains a number of tasks, the user can add as many tasks as he/she wants, he/she can also add images and define the priority of the task (high, medium, etc.) as well as its level (completed, in progress, etc.).

The project still needs some improvements, and some final testing to be done!

### __Installation__

To use the interface you need to install the following requirements:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
